This is Nathan's repo for solutions to AdventOfCode.com, December 2015.

I needed a place to put code so I could share it between computers. Don't steal answers, go solve the problems yourself. This kind of learning is actually really fun, entertaining, and musing. Also, I'm trying to play with nodejs more, so this is the way to do it.

I guess comments are welcome, but, you know, don't ruin my fun.
